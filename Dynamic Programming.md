# Day 1

## Basic Combinatorics using Dynamic Programming
1. Topics you need to cover for internship and placements - Data Structures and techniques.
2. Techniques (overview)
   - [Binary Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html)
   - [Matrix Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html#effective-computation-of-fibonacci-numbers)
2. [Fibonnaci Number](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/fibonacci-numbers.html#matrix-form): Finding the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number, where $1\le n\le 10^{15}$.
3. Find the number of ways to arrange flags on a pole of length $n$. The flags can be of color red, blue and green having length $3, 1, 1$ respectively.



## Question submissions on leetcode
1. [Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/).
2. [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/).

## Introduction to Dynamic Programming topics to be covered
1. $6$ to $7$ problems in Dynamic Programming.
2. Iterative and recursive approach to Dynamic Programming.

## Directed Acyclic Graph
1. The meaning of "Directed", "Acyclic" and "Graph".
2. The meaning of Topological Sorting and its existence. [Video on how to calculate topological sorting (Optional for now)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL-KzMXSXXI)
3. Visualising Dynamic Programming problems as some DAG.
4. Find the minimum length of shortest path to reach a node starting from node $0$ in a DAG (No code! Should be able to do by hand on paper for any DAG in linear time).

## Problems Introduced, not solved
1. [Maximum Subarray Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) - Solution using Kadane's Algorithm. Task is to derive the Kadane algorithm, where $dp[i]$ was defined in the session.
2. Motivation for recursive approach to Dynamic Programming: In a matrix of size $n\times m$, find the longest increasing path. More details on the problem were covered in the session.

## Homework
1. Do some practice on random DAG and fill the dp array on your own.
2. Should be able to do leetcode easy questions. If not able to do, let me know in next session.

## Remarks
Many random things were covered in the session so that you have an idea of what we will be covering in future. If you find the information too much, no need to worry as these will be taken again in future with slow and detailed discussion.

## Plan for next session
1. Submit the code for Kadane's Algorithm after solving on board.
2. Cover easy Dynamic Programming questions of leetcode, no submission on spot for these.
3. If step 2 completed, take some rest, do one problem on DAG on paper and then start Longest Increasing Subsequence and submit the code on leetode.
